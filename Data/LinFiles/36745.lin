mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin confirms that Drijver's double was takeout.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|kareno: The standard Flannery defense has double being takeout of hearts, including spades.|pg||

nt|kareno: West's hand makes me think of my hero Edgar Kaplan's suggestion that it is better if you take out your partner's takeout doubles and leave in his penalty ones.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin: "Ay ay ay ay ay..."|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @S3 lead was 3rd/5th  so hea has a count on that suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C certainly no worse than 63|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @S10  @DAK  @C ruff  @S ruff    and must score 2 more tricks in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just not sure about the order of play yet - or if there is line for overkill overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  i think my line was for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: whoa   same contract  so the overtrick IS critical|pg||
nt|medwards: It seems like a 52 card read-out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is line in vegas about this table reaching board 9|pg||
nt|medwards: I reaally dislike boards being thrown out but what is the solution?|pg||
mc|8|nt|medwards: We have clocks but it does not seem to matter|pg||

nt|kareno: Well, we didn't get the play but the result is excellent for Nickell, a probable win.  And Edgar is once more correct.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin asking about 4NT, which shows the minors.  Some other comment by Drijver has Levin laughing, but not sure what it was.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin claimed after Drijver backed a spade :)|pg||
nt|kareno: There's an expression of minor suits!|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Drijver talking to himself a little here.  |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: A little discussion on both sides of the screen about the holdings.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin: "Nice lead schmo."  Weinstein: "I don't know why you coughed for that."  Levin: "I told you I'm sick."|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|kareno: Too funny|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: (A little reference here to the cheating scandal that deprived the German senior world champions of their medal.)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kareno: And there have been other coughers in bridge history :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: As I'm justly corrected, "that deprived all the German team's opponents of the chance to beat them."|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|kareno: Dana, how many teams are in the final?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: There are 10 teams in the final today.  Each plays 6 total boards against all other teams.|pg||

nt|kareno: The Reisinger may be the toughest team event.  You cannot relax even for a little 2@c contract.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin to Drijver, as he plans to claim: "I assume you don't have @CAQ and @DKJ10.  Oh you do!  You're squeezed."|pg||
mc|12|nt|bobholl: east getting squeezed if he just draws trumps|pg||
nt|kareno: The diamond spots here leave east exposed to a squeeze in the minors.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: We have to shut down the table between each round, as veterans know.  Back in a few.|pg||
