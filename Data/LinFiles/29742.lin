mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkotor: kind of invitational with clubs?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jkotor: Q is for attitude, K would be "unblock or give count"|pg||
nt|jkotor: K is great suit|pg||
nt|ritong: yes  we saw the strong K previously, now we see the weak Q|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Drijver asks about the Q, which is for attitude.|pg||
nt|ritong: attitude over it i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Director came by, saw they are on the last board, and went away.|pg||
nt|ritong: i believe this will take some|pg||
nt|sybarra: they are about a bd behind |pg||
nt|ritong: scoop  monaco lost|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Sorry, he is not close to playing a card yet.|pg||
nt|jkotor: interesting board 30|pg||
nt|ritong: 30 an unexpected tie|pg||
nt|jkotor: they also let 2@s go, but S after ruff could have played club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfu: The ballroom has emptied out as the other teams finish up|pg||
nt|sybarra: except for other table to this match  |pg||
pc|h8|nt|jkotor: then partner puts 9 or Q of @s, and declarer has some decision|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jkotor: i have lots of rumors|pg||
nt|jkotor: about loosing from Monaco team|pg||
nt|jkotor: 120:125 for team Dunitz|pg||
nt|ritong: so what should he do here..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Kalita asks about the strength of Drijver's notrump in this position.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Team Nickell is comparing across the ballroom.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they lost to Duntz,   32  (Monaco that is) |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mitch Dunitz, Sherman Oaks CA; Ed Davis, Seal Beach CA; Jill Levin, Henderson NV; Jenny Wolpert, Jupiter FL; Howard Weinstein, Omaha NE; Ross Grabel, Palm Desert CA|pg||
nt|ritong: pard contributed his lowest @h when count was known|pg||
nt|ritong: this tends to emphsize @d|pg||
nt|swanson:  Saving the specs the trouble of looking it up.|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe @d now?|pg||
nt|jkotor: Q@s is always @s trick for declarer|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|jkotor: now, does he have singleton K or other?|pg||
nt|jkotor: in diamonds|pg||
nt|jkotor: shape is known for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and throwin threat too|pg||
nt|jkotor: and would be endplay if he discards other way with K@d|pg||
nt|ritong: i m told other room not in game|pg||
nt|jkotor: hey kibs, u all see all cards|pg||
nt|ritong: so his problem is: would he duck the @ss with the @d K and the @h K?|pg||
nt|jkotor: but, Bas knows E shape|pg||
nt|jkotor: and it can be singleton K in diamonds now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|ritong: taddammmm....|pg||

nt|jkotor: lol, one more time, if he had now Kx in diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: has no other chance really |pg||
nt|jkotor: or other 2, declarer plays @s or heart and shows cards|pg||
