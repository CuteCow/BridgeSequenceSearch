nt|kit: Spade lead gives declarer  8, but I don't realistically see what he can do but taking losing club finesse|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Hi Karen! :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  S know that decl max has 4 card @s - and with only very few HCP he need suit prefence signal - and N sh know also|pg||
nt|kareno:  hi all from beautiful Sydney|pg||
