nt|chmitty: can you ckeck, operator ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: check ??|pg||
nt|athene: well done both EW pairs on that last board to stay in a nice snug 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: most inexperienced players overbid good hands so they would have gone higher with East|pg||
nt|chmitty: 6@c seems down only on a @s lead|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chmitty: so will they reach 6@c ? will East lead from Qxxx rather than from Qxxxx ?|pg||
nt|athene: now 5@C is ok if it's a "picture bid" i.e. showing really good clubs nothing else|pg||
nt|chmitty: stay with us :)|pg||
nt|athene: but if you take it as just "fast arrival" i.e. showing a poor hand, i think it is definitely an underbid|pg||
nt|athene: and 4@C is much better if available|pg||
nt|athene: one huge problem with raising minors to 5 is you stop partner from blackwooding (or doing anything at all)|pg||
nt|chmitty: Except maybe for strong clubers, 4@c now is definitely forcing and encouraging for slam|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: that doesn't mean you have to restrict the bid to a weak hand but it does mean it has to be very tightly-defined|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: preferably with a certain number of keycards in my opinion|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chmitty: 5@c : more encouraging than 5@c direct, no control in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: surely north will bid six now|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h lead is more neutral (more chances that opponents are short in the suit)|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s lead is more agressive|pg||
nt|chmitty: Drijver knows that South probably often has 3 cards in @d (except a pure 3325)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and certainly not the @d queen + AK @c because he would have nid the slam himself|pg||
nt|chmitty: after his partner encouraged with 4@d|pg||
nt|chmitty: he might pass then|pg||
nt|athene: sure, but there are other things south might have to help the cause like the @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: even @DJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: but it's very tempting to bid 6 : sometimes you have the Queen of @s in your partner's hand, sometimes, they miss the lead ...|pg||
nt|drewsky: and it also seems that south might have called 4NT with a 'better' 5@C bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: uness 4NT there should be a diamond cue|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|chmitty: we'll never know if Thomas would have led a @s against 6 ...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: well it's pretty close and not worth worrying about that much|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s6|nt|drewsky: william perhaps by inference it is sort of a @D que since 4N denies any major control|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: one interesting aspect of bidding i think is that if you know a slam is very close to 50%, you really are not going to gain or lose big by bidding it or not, in the long run|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|h2|pg||

mb|p|nt|chmitty: and moreover lead trump when it's a neutral lead|pg||
nt|athene: if 2NT showed specifically a 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|athene: i think a trump is all the more called for|pg||
nt|athene: although of course leading from xxx in trumps against a 5-3 fit is more risky than against a 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Indeed, Pierre. I was saying the same thing. Very surprising diamond lead.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: as you might find your partner's Qx|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chmitty: maybe with his weakish hand he judged he indeed was in an emergency situation|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4S|nt|athene: i wonder if East would have bid 4@S if not a passed hand?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|6C|nt|athene: when West bids 6@C he must think his partner has a spade void|pg||
nt|athene: he is surely bidding it to make and that looks like a very tall order facing a passed hand unless east has spade void|pg||
nt|chmitty: they are in 5@s x down 2 next door ... so many Imps at stake here|pg||
nt|chmitty: in Drijver's hand|pg||
nt|athene: well you do get a bit of extra equity from the phantom 6@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: after all, West might not be the only person at the table who thinks East is void in spades :)|pg||
nt|athene: some would say "north has already shown his hand with 3@S; he can't consider bidding on here"|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: he really has ZERO defensive tricks against 6@C|pg||
nt|chmitty: Drijver heard 5@s, and not 5@d or 5@h for instance, so the chances of two defensive tricks in South's hand seem remote to me|pg||
nt|athene: and 3@S, although a weak bid, doesn't exactly show zero|pg||
nt|chmitty: but these guys usually know what to do :)|pg||
nt|athene: still i think his options here are really pass and double|pg||
nt|WesleyC:  the tempo is an interesting issue here|pg||
nt|WesleyC:  from S/E it could easily be west that is thinking|pg||
nt|drewsky: the tempo issue depends on which 2 are screemates|pg||
mb|6S|nt|chmitty: usually South and West are on same side of the screen|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes i thought SW / NE|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: so clearly if there is a big NE pause over 6@C it is going to be N not E here|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm sure both NS and EW will have a discussion about this board at diner|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|athene: yes, i think "discussion" is an excellent way to put it|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|drewsky: to me it seems that east's 4@S is simply a sound 5@C bid (not necessarily a slam try)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: well i have noticed the italians make a definite point of showing in competition whenever they have a splinter raise|pg||
nt|athene: if they have a singleton or void in opps' suit they will show it even with few hcp|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: so that is the issue for them rather than the strength|pg||
nt|chmitty: in a similar situation, I heard North telling South : I wanted to tell you I had no defensive trick at all ..." and Southh replied : "Did you forget we are having diner together ? ...|pg||
nt|chmitty: You could have told me then ..."|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: so if EW follow that style (i know they are not italian, BTW :) ) then east bid 4@S because of the singleton spade rather than the strength|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: surely on that auction, north can just pass 6@C with zero defence and double it with one trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: the French style used to be "not" but maybe things have changed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3C|nt|chmitty: Thomas would open 3@c against vulnerable opponents, not here|pg||
nt|athene: south wants to bid 3@S but of course that slightly overstates his hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|athene: ok, 3@H as a passed hand shows a spade fit of course|pg||
nt|athene: and also slightly overstates his hand IMO :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north has a pretty good picture of the hand; declarer will have six clubs to run, probably...the question is how to establish five defensive tricks without giving declarer three ...|pg||
nt|athene: tricks outside clubs|pg||
nt|chmitty: Gromov also passed 1st seat|pg||
nt|athene: do you give him his @HK and hope that isn't trick 9?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: leading a heart doesn't look right - then declarer would have nine if he has @SAK|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: but if he doesn't have @SAK then a spade will work just fine|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: of course as the cards lie nothing will work|pg||
nt|chmitty: declarer can play @d and in case South wins, decide who has the Ace @h|pg||
nt|athene: if south won the @DA and played back the @HQ i am sure declarer would duck twice|pg||
nt|chmitty: easy route to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: south is not going to have @DA @HAQJxx on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: he would have opened for one thing|pg||
nt|WesleyC:  South's 3H bid was certainly unusual here|pg||
nt|athene: and also (as a spectator points out) north's failure to lead a heart implies very strongly he holds the ace|pg||
nt|chmitty: he would play the Queen also with AQxxx but nevertheless the odds are in favour of a duck, I agree|pg||
nt|WesleyC:  but west's 3NT clarified the situation for north|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: actually if all that did occur, north should switch to the @HJ, not the @HQ, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: south should sorry|pg||
nt|chmitty: Next match after a short pause :) enjoy the show !|pg||
nt|athene: because as a passed hand he is more likely to have @HAJxxx than @HAQxxx|pg||
