nt|nilsland:  hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: hello mats|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Cayne asking and Seamon explaining that playing the diamond Q would have end played W for a make|pg||
nt|nilsland:  much trouble with @DQ this boards|pg||
nt|ritong: he knew 5@ss and 6@cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: waiting for other tables to finish and move -- as you know, this is a pair movement and we will see a new EW pair each round|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this was after defence went astray|pg||
nt|ritong: so his real problem was to decide the size of the @d singleton|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will we be able to get scores after a number of rounds or only at end of session?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And for the defense to play that singleton in time|pg||
nt|ritong: that s true|pg||
